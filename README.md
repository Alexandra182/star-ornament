# star-ornament

★ Christmas Star PCB ornament designed for the [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) design contest.

★ Project details:
- The PCB is quite tiny (4x4 cm)
- The middle LEDs are 0603 2mA yellow LEDs (LY L29K-H1K2-26 OSRAM)
- The outer LEDs are 0603 5mA purple and white LEDs (OSVX0603C1E OPTOSUPPLY, LTW-C191TS5 LITEON)
- An ATTINY13-20MMU microcontroller controls the intensity of the LEDs, through two PWM channels, to create a flickering effect
- The star is powered by a CR1225 battery
- There are 4 pads on which hooks can be soldered, in order to hang the star or use it as a wearable :)
