★ Project details:
- The middle LEDs are 0603 2mA yellow LEDs (LY L29K-H1K2-26 OSRAM)
- The outer LEDs are 0603 5mA purple and white LEDs (OSVX0603C1E OPTOSUPPLY, LTW-C191TS5 LITEON)
- An ATTINY13-20MMU microcontroller controls the intensity of the LEDs, through two PWM channels, to create a flickering effect
